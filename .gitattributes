# Treat all files in the Go repo as binary, with no git magic updating
# line endings. Windows users contributing to Go will need to use a
# modern version of git and editors capable of LF line endings.
#
# We'll prevent accidental CRLF line endings from entering the repo
# via the git-review gofmt checks.

# The only exception is Windows files that must absolutely be CRLF or
# might not work. Batch files are known to have multiple bugs when run
# with LF endings. See golang.org/issue/37791 for more information.
