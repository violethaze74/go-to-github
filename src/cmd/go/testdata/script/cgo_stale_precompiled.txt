# Regression test for https://go.dev/issue/47215 and https://go.dev/issue/50183:
# A mismatched $GOROOT_FINAL or missing $CC caused the C dependencies of the net
# package to appear stale, and it could not be rebuilt due to a missing $CC.

# Control case: net must not already be stale.

# https://go.dev/issue/47215: a missing $(go env CC) caused the precompiled net to be stale.
